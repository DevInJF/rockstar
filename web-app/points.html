<tr><td>for breaking a build that already was broken.</td><td>0</td><td>discourages developers from checking in code when the build is already broken. Encourages them to fix a broken build.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for doing a build with no failures. unstable builds gives no stars.</td><td>1</td><td>encourages developers to produce good builds. Encourages developers to check in more frequently to collect more stars. More frequent check-in leads to faster code integration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for each new test that passes.</td><td>1</td><td>encourages developers to add new test scenarios with every check in. More quality, automated test scenarios, lesser effort required on manual testing. Aids quick feedback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for updating actual and todo in rally every day.</td><td>1</td><td>encourages developers to follow standard process which helps in getting correct velocity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for setting planned estimates at story/defect level. Stars given to story owners, story task owners.</td><td>1</td><td>encourages developers to follow standard process which helps in getting correct velocity/burn down.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for completing the story within the iteration. Stars given to story owners, story task owners.</td><td>10</td><td>encourages team work, encourages developers/qa/product owners to better slice the story and finish the story in one iteration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for getting the story accepted in the same iteration. Sooner the story is accepted more the stars. Stars given to story owners, story task owners. Associate leads and above get 1 star per story getting accepted. </td><td>25,20,15,10</td><td>encourages team work, encourages developers/qa/product owners to better slice the story, finish and get the story accepted within iteration.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for giving internal training, presentations; knowledge sharing. you have to claim these stars from your manager</td><td>30</td><td>encourages and enhances presentation skills, knowledge sharing, encourages continuous dialogue with managers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for participating and presenting your idea in ShipIt. you have to claim these stars from your manager.</td><td>50</td><td>encourages innovation, initiative, proactivness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for writing technical blogs, articles, answering stack overflow questions etc. you have to claim these stars from your manager.</td><td>50</td><td>encourages knowledge sharing, community contribution and expression of thoughts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for open source contribution. you have to claim these stars from your manager.</td><td>75</td><td>encourages community contribution.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for becoming ShipIt Innovator. you have to claim these stars from your manager.</td><td>100</td><td>encourages innovation, initiative, proactivness.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for giving presentations in technology conferences. you have to claim these stars from your manager.</td><td>200</td><td>encourages developers/qa to participate in conferences, knowledge sharing, branding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wild Card – other tangible/intangible value addition/creation. You have to claim these stars from your managers. These stars are discretionary; based on perceived value addition.</td><td>*</td><td>encourages going above and beyond your responsibilities. Encourages continuous dialog with managers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for each new test failures</td><td>-1</td><td>discourages bugs, encourages fixing flaky tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>if story/defect does not have planned estimates (per day). Stars removed from story owners, story task owners. Associate leads and above get -2 per story that does not have planned estimates.</td><td>-2</td><td>encourages dialog between leads and team members.</td></tr>
<tr><td>For not tasking a story (per day). Stars removed from story owners. Associate leads and above get -2 per story that does not have tasks.</td><td>-5</td><td>encourages planning</td></tr>
<tr><td>for NOT updating actual and todo in rally every day.</td><td>-5</td><td>encourages developers/qa to follow process. Historical actual data helps to determine how much efforts went on a particular module/feature/release etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for leaving the story in prior iterations without getting those accepted. Stars removed from story task owners.</td><td>-5</td><td>encourages dialog between product owners, managers and members and making sure that the work is complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for breaking a build.</td><td>-10</td><td>encourages taking builds on local machine before check-in. encourages fixing flaky tests. encourages team members to respect each others valuable time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>for story spill over. Stars removed from story owners, story task owners. Associate leads and above get -5 per story that gets spilled over.</td><td>-20</td><td>encourages planning, story mapping, slicing and completing the story in the given iteration and getting quicker feedback.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Production Bug. Stars deducted from all the individuals involved in the story. Product owners, developers, qa. Based on managers discretion as not every bug has the same impact.</td><td>-200</td><td>encourages code quality.</td></tr>

			<h1>Simple way of gaining big stars -> If I am working on a story for a complete iteration (8 working days) and I check in code 3 times a day and I add two new test scenarios per check-in and I make sure that the story is complete and accepted within the iteration that gives me 100 stars. Better sliced stories, following agile practices give me even better reward!</h1>
